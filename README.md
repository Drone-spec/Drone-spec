- ðŸ¥µ Hi, Iâ€™m @Drone-spec
## Intro

Yo yo dudes whats up, welcome to my github page.

Hopefully in the time that you see this my page is not empty. Currenty being kept ultra busy and my notes are garbo at best. I try to keep it light and full of swears. I will always be honest with my opinions on many many tech related topics.

## Tasks
- I am working on more content to provide for peeps on a wide range of topics.
- Giving private lessions on offensive and devleopment.
- Trying to work on making some youtube videos on obscure topics. 
- Working on growing my Green side more and more. Development is hard and very rewarding. 

## Side notes
I have a ton of handles but if you need to find me just message me. I love to chat about nothing for WAY too long.
